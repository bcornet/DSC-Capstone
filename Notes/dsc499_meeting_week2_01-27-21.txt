[Caitlin has a kidney infection AND it's her birthday,
 may dip out during the meeting here and there]


Brianna:
air quality index (AQI) in data set? [yep]

originlab.com/index.aspx
[was free last year, $60/year sub for students]

geographic clustering: in China, will expand to US
lots of regression analyses

	Marco asks: assumption of independent variables?
	Brianna: lots of covariate variables are grouped together in dict
	e.g. tumors_count and tumors_size -> tumor_mass
	also considering danger from tumor itself (benign vs. malignant)
	
	Scott asks: is this data set public?
	Brianna: yes and no; from NIH, can be obtained through request with proposal
	
	Scott asks: who are Yasaman and Kievan?
	Brianna: you sent me an email, goofus
	
	Scott asks: summary of project? (I missed it)
	Scott asks: hospital collab still intact?
	Brianna: yes through Yasaman/Kievan (probably)
	
	Scott asks: types of smokers (x pack/day, second-hand, etc.)
	Brianna: several groups, but nothing about 2nd-hand

	Cachelle asks: regional correlation regardless of smoking?
	Brianna: spatial data possible, need to see what the data shows



Bri: bunch of questions, I forget
- send github link to Scott

	Brianna asks: would simpler words help with recognition?
	- OCR looks for characters rather than words, so it doesn't care
	- it DOES have an issue with strange fonts and characters, but correction methods are designed to improve character detection



Hunter: [I missed the whole thing]



Nick: SUPERMARKET SWEEEP
- finding out why customers go to distant stores to get items offered at the same price
- Coop dataset
column names? how was it compiled?

	Bri asks: what unit is "AMOUNT_SPENT" in? three decimals, so not USD
	Nick: it's in the data set dictionary
	
	Scott asks: any US data?
	Nick: maybe, but focus is on this set for now
	
	Marco asks: any data for individual rather than supermarket?
	Nick: [I missed this]
	


Cachelle: DATAMATCH
platform to import/clean dataset
ML methods relevant to dataset

Boostrap 4, CSS, JavaScript, Flask

[missed a bunch, oops]

is the website live? still on laptop
thinking ahead: hosting? not sure yet
hosting temporary? github probably
- can add readme/wiki to repeat
intended audience? e.g. tutorials for beginners or expected?
- intended for all!
planning to support ANY data set? guidelines necessary
can you have something to evaluate the data set?
- how to determine if a set is clean?
method to cast columns as various objects and evaluate null percentage?
- maaaybe

MASCOT? most important question in your entire career


Jimmy aka Leo aka Jimmy: PAYROLLIN'
[Jimmy wants in on the sports stats field]

Lahman package in R data libraries


obvious, but COVID cutoff (no data for 2020 season and beyond)

	Scott: measuring success? 
	Leo: playoff depth
	
	Scott: data includes runs scored, runs allowed, etc.?
	Leo: has stats from seasons from 1851-present including player stats
	
	Scott: payroll from lahman?
	Leo: salary set in database
	Scott: group by role (starting/closing pitchers, etc.)
	
	Scott: visualization tools? tableau?
	Leo: we were gonna use it in DSC 201 but it was dropped
	Cachelle: free for students, easy to get activation codes, can change data through tableau
	Scott: UMD tableau link?
	Cachelle: posting it in chat
	Brianna: we used it in DSC 201
	Cachelle: PowerBI?

Ziyu: COVID-19 cluster analysis
[missed this]

	Ziyu: yes, just trying to figure out how to fit it in
	
	Scott: Donghui works on this, any work with him?
	Ziyu: I would but I don't have the time for it
	Scott: any coordination with him?
	Ziyu: last semester yes, this semester no


Marco: quick summary about scan
KNN: k-nearest neighbor
convolutionary neural networks, meta modeling
training to define differences of numeric shapes
[no questions!]


next week: project updates and discussion
- discuss what ye did
- beginning of semester reports due
-- key factor is TIMELINE! can be bullet points even, just summarize

- special topic talk: first come, first serve
- dates are also first come, first serve
