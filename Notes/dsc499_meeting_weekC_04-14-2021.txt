TOPIC TALKIES:
CACHELLE: Intro to Flask, LinkedIn Tips

Flask: python module for web development
- see also django, web2py
why Flask? because it's good, damn it
includes blueprint library

download on Windows:
	1. create folder
	2. py-3 -m venv myproject
	3. install pip (py -m pip --version)
	4. pip install flask
	5. create some python file, like flask.py
	6. export FLASK_APP=flask.py
	7. run Flask Command flask run

download on Ubuntu:
	mkdir myproject
	cd myproject
	python3-m venv venv
	pip install flask
	[oops there's more]

running the program always goes to the first route listed
here, it's the /about page (even though the root exists)


from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, make_response, send_file

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return "Here's what's up with Flask"

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "hello world"

if '_name_' = '_main_':
    app.run(debug=True)


(a lot of stuff is being said and I can't parse it quick enough)
can edit HTML directly I guess?
seems like you can isolate code chunks inside each route

	Bri: where'd you first learn about Flask?
	Cachelle: was in a program that had a software engineering event
	had a demo version of titanic data, used Flask for API system
	I connected with the person running it and asked about it
	seemed neat, I like it
	
OH YEAH, if you make the HTML files, make it in the folder
it's a huge mess if you try to import them from something else
also can make dashboards
also can get file/data in python, send to HTML to render as a JSON

	Scott: can you run a jupyter notebook through flask?
	seems like it just needs a python kernel to run
	Cachelle: probably, seen other people do it
	Scott: just googled and got lots of hits for this, woo

LinkedIn: career platform for finding jobs/internships and networking
stepz:
	make profile
	add work/volunteer eperience
	add summary (skills, passion, resume)
	build network!
	find a job probably
	join in conversations

good profile has a bunch of stuff:
title of current position
add passion/story in summary
research projects and current program
- guy shows he codes for fun

bad profile stuff:
personal/silly pictures
non-descriptive history

[there's a lot but I missed it]


Ziyu: Data Visualization
helpin people interpret results quickly!
interactivity: add dimensionality not possible through static images
examples: 
cdc.gov/coronavirus
covid.cdc.gov
(a lot, all related to COVID)



UPDATES!

Marco:
submitted paper, got feedback, new submission tonight
filled in table for left side
ran CNN, KNN, have algorithm on whole dataset
question: after doing so many methods, how do I compress to 15 minute talk?
Scott: do an overview slide discussing all the things you did
you won't be able to focus on all of them
might be able to go over algorithms for one or two of them
CNN maybe since it did the best
distance measure maybe too
summary results for all of them
but yeah, can't get into detail in all, just summarize
comparison rather than showing math
if people ask questions, you can focus on that
otherwise you'll run out of time or confuse people by rushing
so something like tangent distance, don't get into that too deep
also ROC curve for CNN and supervised k-means maybe


reminder: dry run talks on the 28th!


Brianna:
been looking at comments for feedback
biggest questions are about SCOTT'S HANDWRITING
[oh it actually doesn't look that bad]


Cachelle:
worked on html and it works!
runs ML code, displays image, all of it
fixed various glitches


Ziyu:
demonstration of map with slide-bar
report tonight, maybe tomorrow
	Marco: daily states? sum of states put together?
	Ziyu: sum of states?
	Marco: sum of all states or single states?
	Ziyu: single state, based on box at the top right
	Marco: maybe indicate interactivity? click here, etc.
	Scott: youtube demo video embed?
	Ziyu: well I'll do something, it'll be easy
	Scott: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology
	SIR model and plots


[had to leave due to work things]
