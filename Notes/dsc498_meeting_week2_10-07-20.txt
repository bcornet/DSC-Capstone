Week 2 technically!

presentation time baby!


Brianna: Cancer screening
Bri: Image scanning
Nick: Supermarkets analysis
Cachelle: Data Science about Data Science
Marco: ML on handwritten digits
Leo: Baseball salary cap, pitching vs. hitting by salary

Brianna: have you discussed selecting a cancer based on its relation to potential long-term effects of COVID-19?
alternatively, will COVID have any impact on your choice?
same for Nick, where shopping habits are affected by the pandemic

Cachelle: why not something that analyzes "unclean" data?
	determine how homogeneous a column is:
		deviation of possible values
		flexibility of data under different types
	spot null values


in every class, we talk for 10-15 minutes to discuss source, progress, etc.
basically weekly reports like with Julia
