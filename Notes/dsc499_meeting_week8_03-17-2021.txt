RIP spring break


HUNTER: Topic talk!
Demographics and the Economy
- exploring populations and economics duh
heatmap for percentage of people in each country living in cities

graph: urbanization supposedly related to decreasing birth rates (R^2 = 0.33 ish, eh)

another map of birth rates as an average by country (rainbow color scheme)

pre-industry context: fewer opportunities to change position, lower life expectency
industrial revolution changed those


urbanization leads to better living conditions, more disposable income/free time, etc.
leads to children becoming more expensive and declining birth rates
awesome time flow of Japan's population by age from 1910s to present

solution: France method!
- make it financially easier to have a child
- very generous welfare system and healthcare
- expensive to implement but it definitely works
started at some point after WW2
- during German occupation, birth rates started to go up (was lower previously for some reason)

American method! immigration
- #1 popular destination for immigration
- may lead to stoppage when source countries stabilize


Japanese method! automation
- needs to rely on robots to overcome lack of workers
- problem is robots pay no taxes, so no circulation


supposedly several countries are past the point of recovering:
Germany, Russia, Italy, Taiwan, Spain, EU in general, Singapore, Thailand

what defines the point?
	aging population places a significant strain on the economy
	#1 reason to not have a child is financial burden
	growth as a differential equation: fewer base -> fewer kids -> fewer base -> loop

some book both Hunter and Scott heard about:
https://www.amazon.com/One-Billion-Americans-Thinking-Bigger-ebook/dp/B082ZR6827

says USA should aim for 1 billion people

Russia method: free appliances for having kids (basically like France method)
https://www.heraldnet.com/news/in-russia-have-a-baby-win-a-refrigerator/

20-year lag from child to tax-paying adult is a factor too

Scott: Andrew Yang talking about taxing robots
Hunter: no problem has faced this before, Japan will be the first, good luck for em
also gonna be an interesting century


===============
UPDATES
===============

BRIANNA:
finally got access to the data on friday
going through data still
not everyone in the trial actually had primary diagnose lung cancer
- cancer spread from other sources to the lungs

took like 10 minutes to process, cut it down to relevant columns
smoker, nonsmoker, current smoker, former smoker, etc.

made plots but they're ugly
made histograms, more interesting

	Scott: big spike at around 1400-ish, maybe from different types of cancer?
	
examining correlation studies and linear regression basically

	Scott: look at days-to-death histogram given the stage?
	Brianna: yes, but it's being dumb, here's the plot
	pretty equally concentrated aside from stage 2

263 columns, 150k rows or so, all values as numerics
72.7 MB; smaller than terrorism data set for MTH 522 but we knew what to use for that going in



JIMMY:
was super busy so not much to say
left off with joins and tableau
question was if we can get regression plots and such working
will probably go to office hours more

	Scott: I'm no Tableau expert, but I'm okay



BRI:
added denoise function with cv2; can also do multi-image from stream
tested on MHGU image; visible changes in removing noise but not a complete smoothing
- artifacts from jpeg compression are still present, as are jaggies
- white text tends to blur with lighter backgrounds (first row, first col)

compared accuracy vs. no denoise on MHGU table with dictionary correction
- slightly worse accuracy overall, particularly on first row
- some improvements, notably on detecting empty strings in first col

general conclusion: can apply as an optional transform for empty strings
otherwise should just be used for camera denoise



MARCO:
showing off neural network from his google notebook
(I'm missing most of this because I'm writing my own thing)	



NICK:
not much progress
still working with SQL

	Scott: maybe drop the SQL part
	Bri: definitely not needed unless you wanna have a database modified over time on a network
	anything you can do in R or Python is totally sufficient
	Scott: considering time limits (2 weeks until April), should probably do that
	even if an accessible database was part of the original idea, 
	the actual analysis is more relevant to DSC
	also you're further along with that, so focus on that


CACHELLE:
went during office hours

HUNTER:
more R errors
- R types: lists, collections, so on
we fixed it!
now run that sucka



I gotta peeeee
