DSC498 week 3 - 10/14

Nick: got some data, set it up! that's it

Brianna: preparing for final selection, has a report on what/why
- cancer types, screening processes, impact of cancer (NOT just survival rate)
- data:
	quantitative (bloodwork, tumor markers, biopsy results, genetics)
	qualitative (physical exam, fam. history, scan results, subtype of cancer)
- thyroid: examining overdiagnoses, long-term implications of treatment vs. lack thereof
- lung: looking at causes that aren't triggered by first-hand smoking
- other cancers considered but not used: 
- there's three: advisor, grad student (lung/breast), Brianna (thyroid/breast)
- will select if there's a great data set to go with

Bri: tested with MSPaint image, ACNH, MHGU
- can succeed with text broken down by blocks, but may still have issues with accuracy
- will still require breaking down image into sections either by user or through recognition

Leo: found some basic MLB data!
- "last 25 world series winners with payroll ranks"
- "average wins and average payroll from 2006-2008"
- team payrolls by year
- hypothesis: salary matters less than quality of players
- what about draft picks? individual salaries and performances? other sports?

Marco: reading and programming
- understanding tangent distance instead of SVD or Euclidean
- can't run because it's a slow algorithm?
- seems to be m*n*k for m*n pixels and k rotations?
- Marco thinks the issue is with his implementation mostly
- Donghui asks: is it slow in the training stage or the testing stage?
	it seems like there's a lot of duplicate calculations
	calculate the matrix for each version

Ziyu: COVID-19 in the US from April to ?
- no idea

Cachelle: absent, what gives?
