We strongly advise that all new students attend this event. All students might benefit from attending and are welcome to attend.

  Where: Zoom: https://umassd.zoom.us/j/98127374327?pwd=MjRTa0tyQzVMSVZzNkppVUJ5U1FiUT09
  When: 12:00 - 1:00pm
  What: Important program information (including the practicum and internships) will be discussed as well as a Q&A with faculty and recent alumni. 

  See many of you tomorrow!

Scott

[I forgot to take more notes]



if you have friends who are likely to complete a thesis, you're more likely to complete your own!


Brianna -> planning on thesis: do we take 690 before 550?
550 is required IF you don't do the thesis! you may need to formally enroll just for the registrar side of things
alternatively, 550 into 690 as a continuation IF the topic is viable
will be figured out, and not to your detriment!
