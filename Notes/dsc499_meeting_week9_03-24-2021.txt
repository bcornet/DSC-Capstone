UPDATES:

BRIAN: no real update due to last-minute topic talk and other work
- generally on track!
- checklist is out of date apparently
- may take an extra week at the start of April to tidy project





ZIYU:
made map with time slider
doesn't work?
may have an issue with empty values on certain dates:
not every state has an update on every date

goal is to have the colors appear over each state

clusters are identified, so that's good

timeline: seems to be on track
	Scott: MA counties? can we replicate this at a county level?
	Ziyu: could, but time-wise probably not
Marco did something like that for another class already I guess, good for him



MARCO:
was on CNN, should be doing meta-modelling according to instructor
combine model!

epoch vs. accuracy plot (test and train lines)
another graph of #models vs. accuracy
green dots for single model accuracy, blue connected dots for combined accuracy
can distribute weights of each model in the combined

timeline: lookin good



BRIANNA:
stacked histogram for smoker types (smoker / current, former; non)
former has a weird gap between 2000 and 3000 days
made another set for stages of progression
on track!
