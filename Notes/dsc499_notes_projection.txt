homographies:
	a: horizontal stretch (scale)
	e: vertical stretch (scale)

	b: horizontal shear (skew)
	d: vertical shear (skew)

	c: horizontal shift (translation)
	f: vertical shift (translation)

	g: xz perspective distortion
	h: yz perspective distortion

(a,b,d,e cover rotation)

physical limitations:
- rotation could be anywhere in 360 degrees
- perspective is limited to (-90, 90) degrees [can't take a picture from behind screen]

in reality:
- people generally don't take super off-angle pictures
- both rotation and perspective are likely within 45 degrees
- 90/180/270 rotations for camera gyro may be worth considering
- if a person can't read something, a computer probably can't either



rotation_spacing.py uses Radon transform
unproject_text.py uses Hough transform




horizontal skew (final transform):
- go for minimum width of widest character OR soft max of convex hulls
