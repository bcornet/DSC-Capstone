Scott: busy day! working on a grant to fund DSC research
getting like 10 emails every half hour

today is just more project update talks


Bri: look into details on methods, updates

pull request: Scott's gonna tell me about it later
- fixed issue with line 135



Brianna:
- looking into new data sets
- focusing on data that isn't normally looked at
- found a lot of trash, but one good one from 2009 for non-smokers
was 10% non-smokers with lung cancer, now 20%?
has year-over-year for data of lung cancer types
also includes case scenarios for lots of cooking environments (coal stoves, deep fryers, etc.)
info from iarcce.com, can get it but it requires approval

	Scott: this project raises good questions about limiting the scope of a project
	Brianna: issues with groups (smoked once ever grouped with pack a day)
coal mining study

check out this site:
https://zenodo.org/
journals where data sets are (mostly) required!


Marco:
- tested a hyper parameter (the k in k means)
- majority vote testing from 1 though 10
- doesn't seem to make a huge difference in variance regardless of k (<1%)
- used cross-validation (k-fold) [test half against half]
	Scott: keep looking at k-nearest neighbors or move to convolutional neural networks?
	Marco: probably! in time


Cachelle:
- working on the page, including summary
- need sample data! scipy maybe


Nick:
- asked manager about data?
- google search of dataset, found some on kaggle.com
- plots in csv file, possibly from tableau


Jimmy:
- looked at tutorials in [something] package, looked at 538
- wants to focus on performance after signing contract to predict performance tanking

	Scott: if you come across a dataset locked behind a paywall (like $50 or so), DSC can pay for it!
	- maybe not a $1000 set but something cheapish


Hunter:
- had problem with data set not compiling with code
- keras library is bein butts maybe
	Marco: if you load two libraries that use the same function, one will overwrite the other
	Scott: that's awful




LAST COMMENTS:
topic talks?
	gonna email details
	Leo wants to go over the background of his talk
	Brianna: AWS next gen stats for sports stuff
	Scott had a friend who looked into getting an analyst position with the Cubs, was SUPER HARD and competitive
	Cachelle: LinkedIn too
	Scott: maybe start low on the totem poll, then work your way up
	- get in with UMD baseball team!
	- guy who made this got hired by some university's coach, expects to move up over time
