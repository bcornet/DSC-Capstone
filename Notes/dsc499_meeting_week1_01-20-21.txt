10% special topic talks


github code needs to be both available, working, non-shitty

2-3 pages for intro report
1 page for "what are you trying to answer"
1 page for "where do things stand"
1 page for "what needs to be done"

basically a summary, can be bullet points


bad: "I need data for my model"
good: "I need validated MLB payroll data from 2015-2018 in .csv"

reports don't need to be long (8 or 10 is an absolute MAX)
don't want a laundry list of what was done, 
just summarize and highlight

special topic talks is to talk about something you excel at
related to data science (generally tools)
estimated 5-20 minutes (10 expected)


Scott: gonna do github tutorial

project updates: short and to the point, 5-10 minutes

remember to aim for 5 hours/week! don't need to revolutionize


send intro report as pdf
include name/class in title

"Scott Field DS report"

SCOTT DOESN'T HAVE MICROSOFT WORD
(probably for the best)


meetings can go on until we're done
expect to leave by 4:30 anyway
