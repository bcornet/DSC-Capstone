general idea:
- use existing paper as base
- go over new methods:
-- Rotation
-- Skewing
-- Denoise
-- Edge Detection (Canny)
- expand on dictionary
- evaluate accuracy
- discuss unused methods and future considerations
-- font sample (can calculate distance)
-- CNN
-- Image Difference


Focus of methods on:
- recognizing regions of interest (ROI)
- determining the most effective correction methods for a given image
- text correction
