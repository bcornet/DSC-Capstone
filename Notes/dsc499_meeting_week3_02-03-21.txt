LUNCH TALKS
http://cscvr1.umassd.edu/seminars-2020.html

some are recorded!


in class: about 15-20 minutes
in cscvr: about 45-60 minutes


DON'T FORGET THE REPORT! due tonight

at most:
1 page of a timeline
2 pages of what you're doing, why you're doing it, what you've done

did you know Scott keeps detailed notes about what we're presenting?
iiiiiiiiit's true


MARCO:
three algorithms so far
new one: KNN (K-nearest neighbors)
has a confusion matrix [compare interpreted to actual]

now using MNIST database

	Scott: a lot of algorithms are cloaked in terminology despite being simple!

YOUR HANDWRITING IS NOT TERRIBLE MARCO
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF

distribution of characters can affect interpretation

	Scott: are you saying having more 8s would improve acc. of 8?
	Marco: opposite; having more 0s would improve acc. of 8

7s interpreted as 1s, but 1s not interpreted as 7s
4s as 9s, but 9s more likely to be seen as 7s

set a k based off of the error rate? approx 95% accurate currently
height scaling for euclidean distance?
- solution was to preprocess database so lines are hopefully centered
- but nothing for rescaling?
	Marco: this would be a lot of work! [would it though?]
	- determine each character's height/width
	- determine average height/width
	- skew each character to average

also had troubles with uint8 and differences
- solved by converting to int32 to handle difference/squares properly

60000*10000 something or others



BRIANNA:
epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data

comparing air quality in US vs. lung cancer incidences
firefighter rates to look at
smoking history, age

county-level data? may be available in EU countries [smaller regions]
air quality: any composition of specific chemicals?
everyone in the study is mostly over 50

	Scott: if person is non-smoking and in age group, is occ. of lung cancer affected by variables? something like that

	Marco: does screening info have details about where an individual lives? [e.g. patient lives on Cape Cod but screens in Boston]
	Brianna: good question! can look



BRI:
figuring out how to do it, THEN make sense of the innerworkings
- radon, blackman, rfft, etc.

next week: look at skewing!
- rotation is just xy-plane; need xz- and yz-planes



JIMMY:
having trouble filtering (slicing?)
recommended by Scott and apparently Donghui:
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8/topics/filter
maybe also tableau

should maybe do comparison of players by salary?
- yes! it's interesting, it's another angle to explore

check out 538 for a jumping off point


[had to leave at this point]
