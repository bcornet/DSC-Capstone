# DSC-Capstone
UMass Dartmouth Data Science Capstone Project - Repository for DSC 498/499 files

**Project:** "Raw Image Scanner" (feel free to come up with an actual name)

**Contact:** [Brian Cornet](mailto:bcornet@umassd.edu?subject=[GitHub]%20I%20clicked%20a%20thing)

**Instructor:** [Scott Field](mailto:sfield@umassd.edu?subject=[GitHub]%20DSC499%20Capstone%20%2D%20Brian%20Cornet)

## Structure
Relevant project files will be kept in the root directory. This includes the primary script "tess.py" and various sample images used in experimentation. Note that you'll need to instsall Tesseract OCR and PyTesseract in order to run this.

Check the Notes folder for weekly notes and doodles. Presentations contains various Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation (.pptx) and Microsoft Word Document (.docx) files both in their original formats and as .pdf files. As of January 26th, the latter folder takes up about 60 MB, so heads up.

## What's the Deal?
I came up with a bunch of project ideas for the capstone, most of which I was hoping would be useful or enlightening to develop. This one was my favorite, so I went with it. Pretty sure my plan was to use this to make it easier to nerd out over my stats and inventories in video games. Bonus: being able to use images from stuff I like as examples! It's been a hoot thus far. The last semester was largely a matter of familiarizing myself with Tesseract OCR with some basic experiments involving image clean-up. Taking ECE 621 at the same time was super convenient too.

## Project To-Doots
- [x] Install Tesseract OCR and PyTesseract
- [x] Experiment with basic PyTesseract commands in Python
