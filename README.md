# DSC-Capstone
UMass Dartmouth Data Science Capstone Project - Repository for DSC 498/499 files

**Project:** "Raw Image Scanner" (feel free to come up with an actual name)

**Contact:** [Brian Cornet](mailto:bcornet@umassd.edu?subject=[GitHub]%20I%20clicked%20a%20thing)

**Instructor:** [Scott Field](mailto:sfield@umassd.edu?subject=[GitHub]%20DSC499%20Capstone%20%2D%20Brian%20Cornet)

## Structure
Relevant project files will be kept in the root directory. This includes the primary script "tess.py" and various sample images used in experimentation. Note that you'll need to instsall Tesseract OCR and PyTesseract in order to run this.

Check the Notes folder for weekly notes and doodles. Presentations contains various Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation (.pptx) and Microsoft Word Document (.docx) files both in their original formats and as .pdf files. As of January 26th, the latter folder takes up about 60 MB, so heads up.

## Project To-Doots
- [x] Install Tesseract OCR and PyTesseract
- [x] Experiment with basic PyTesseract commands in Python
- [x] Investigate methods for improving OCR accuracy
- [x] Implement word and character highlighter
- [x] Implement bitplane seperator
- [x] Implement discrete wavelet transform method
- [x] Implement Levenshtein ratio/distance method
- [x] Prepare final presentation and report (DSC 498)
- [ ] Implement noise removal method
- [ ] Implement dilation/erosion methods
- [ ] Implement rotation method
- [ ] Implement border addition/removal methods
- [ ] Experiment with automating correction methods
- [ ] Experiment with off-screen text-based images
- [ ] Experiment with user-defined dictionary support
- [ ] \(Optional) Begin development of image comparison methods
- [ ] Prepare final presentation and report (DSC 499)
