# DSC-Capstone
UMass Dartmouth Data Science Capstone Project - Repository for DSC 498/499 files

**Contact:** [Brian Cornet](bcornet@umassd.edu)

**Project:** "Raw Image Scanner" (feel free to come up with an actual name)

## Structure

Relevant project files will be kept in the root directory. This includes the primary script "tess.py" and various sample images used in experimentation. Note that you'll need to instsall Tesseract OCR and PyTesseract in order to run this.

Check the Notes folder for weekly notes and doodles. Presentations contains various Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation (.pptx) and Microsoft Word Document (.docx) files both in their original formats and as .pdf files. As of January 26th, the latter folder takes up about 60 MB, so heads up.
